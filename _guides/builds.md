# Recommended Builds

Anti-Xeno operations require specialised ship builds as Thargoids have special resistances and deal special damage types that will typically render a standard combat build useless. As such, we have put together the following guide to help you make the correct decisions to lead you towards building the most effective ship for hunting down Thargoid vessels. These ship builds are designed to maximize firepower and survivability, allowing any commander, regardless of skill level, to achieve victory.

## Ship Build Types

Due to the variety of Thargoid Vessels and locations in which they may be encountered, there are a variety of specialized build classes required for Anti-Xeno combat.
As a rule of thumb, **a solo-capable build is always the best option.** Variantions on the solo builds below form the core of all other build classes, as more specialized technology is usually required for more hostile locations.

There are two common build types used for Anti-Xeno Combat:

- **Fast Shieldless Builds** (Cold Orbiters) - Fast ships that use no shield and cold mechanics to evade damage
- **Slow Shielded Builds** (Shield Tanks) - Slow ships with large shields, using reboots to regenerate shields periodically

In addition, there are many different AX activities, and the builds for them can be quite different:

- **Solo Builds** - One commander, one (or more) interceptors. These builds form the basis of all other builds, and you should always start here.
- **AXCZ Builds** - These builds are solo builds with various modifications to make them better suited for fighting in groups. Group AX presents a few hazards which usually aren't seen in solo fights.
- **Maelstrom Builds** - Heavily specialized for combat in the most extreme locations - where caustic clouds are thick, staying undetected is paramount, and guardian tech is useless. These build have the same base hull configuration as Solo Builds, but share little else.
- **Scout Builds** - Like shooting fish in a barrel, Thargoid Scouts put up little resistance to a few Enhanced AXMCs.
- **Spire Builds** - Even more like shooting fish in a barrel, Thargoid Spire sites are very low intensity combat zones where Cyclops interceptors and Scouts occasionally spawn, and where Orthrus interceptors are found in large numbers. Builds for Spire sites are designed for maximum shield damage to Orthrus.

# Best In Class - Krait Mk.II

In the current meta, the **Krait Mk.II is the most versatile ship**. With the ability to mount any weapon, plenty of optional internals, a massive powerplant, and good maneuverability, the Krait Mk.II is the **best all-around starter build**.

        <h3>Solo Build</h3>
        <p>
        The shieldless Krait is a tried and true powerhouse. The Krait's massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any AX weapon effectively. This build is designed specifically for solo fights, and is lacking in coutermeasures against caustic and shutdown fields (which can be avoided solo).

        <p>
        This build has a Thermal Vent Beam Laser instead of Flak, and brings a Shutdown Field Neutralizer and Caustic Sink Launcher to mitigate the added hazards found in AXCZs. The limpets and cargo rack can be safely removed if fighting at a planetary or station CZ with active station.

# Solo Builds

These builds are designed for **solo combat**, meaning one commander engaged with one or more interceptors. They have different requirements than Wing AXCZ or Maelstrom builds, but they form the core of all other builds.

Thargoid Interceptors are **very tough and powerful enemies** that will require equally strong ships to be able to stand a chance in combat. Due to the incredibly high damage output of Thargoid Interceptors, there are only a handful of different styles and methods you can use effectively.

## Beginner Builds

When starting out, stick to the tried and true. The Chieftain and the Krait have been the best ships for AX combat for a long time. The Chieftain offers exceptional agility paired with an excellent set of hardpoints. The Krait trades agility for firepower and is able to run four medium AX weapons. The odd one out is the Imperial Cutter as a large shielded ship, offering an entirely different style of combat.

      <h4>Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)</h4>
      <p>The shieldless Alliance Chieftain is the undisputed AX meta, just like the Fer-de-Lance in PVP. Providing good hull, cargo space, agility, and firepower, the Chieftain is able to effortlessly cold orbit while maintaining devastating gauss fire. Its ample hardpoints also allow for four gauss cannons in addition to a flak launcher and thermal vent beam laser. Its sister ship, the Alliance Challenger, provides more damage and hull at the cost of speed.</p>
      <p>Type: Cold Orbiter</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>

        <li>Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>
        <li>Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recommendation: Unarguably the best ship and build style for AX combat.</p>

      <h4>Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)</h4>
      <p>The shieldless Krait, while not as maneuverable as the Chieftain, provides a greater damage output. The Krait’s massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any guardian weapon effectively. This is also a great platform for mounting Enhanced AXMCs for commanders who do not yet have access to guardian tech.</p>
      <p>Type: Cold Orbiter</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Recommendation: Great for modified shard cannons and plasma chargers.</p>
      <p>Engineering Note: When downsizing the powerplant for extra weight reduction, power limits will require more engineering to keep everything running. Check EDSY for minimum engineering based on your specific build.</p>

      <h4>Imperial Cutter (Shielded)</h4>
      <p>If you prefer flying large ships the Imperial Cutter is the recommended ship to go with. Out of all the large ships, the Cutter is the only one capable of effectively outrunning most Thargoid Interceptors. The Cutter relies on Prismatic shields to tank large amounts of damage. If you intend to use the Cutter, we recommend reading the Anti-Xeno Large Ship Guide.</p>

## Intermediate Builds

These builds are targeted at more experienced commanders, either those who have flown the above ships against Thargoids before or have prior PVP combat experience. These ships offer different flight characteristics, new hardpoint setups and generally some variety while requiring more experience to use effectively.

      <h4>Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)</h4>
      <p>The Alliance Challenger, sister ship of the more popular Alliance Chieftain, is a slower alternative with higher damage output against an interceptor’s shields. Depending on preference, it can also have more raw hull than a standard Chieftain build. Its three medium hardpoints with good convergence make it a better platform for running modified Shard Cannons or Plasma Chargers.</p>

      <p>One of the “big three” the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. When shieldless, it stays icy cold while firing on all cylinders.</p>

# Titan Builds

Titan Maelstroms contain an anti-guardian field and large caustic zones. Specialized ships are required to be effective in these operating conditions, and Guardian internal modules will be destroyed; Guardian weapons (but not modules) can, however, be engineered to avoid this. These are modifications of other meta ships, designed to either strike directly at the Titan itself, or to provide combat interdiciton to Thargoid Scouts or Interceptors in Titan space, with various specific modifications.

## Extra Modules Suggested

- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Protects you from the caustic clouds and missiles present in Maelstrom combat.
- **Thargoid Pulse Neutralizers** - Required for passing into the center of a Maelstrom, these also act against Interceptor shutdown pulses.
- **Thermal Vent engineered Beam Lasers** - These enable cold running in combat, reducing the likelihood and accuracy of incoming fire.
- **Nanite Torpedo Launcher** - This torpedo launcher can damage the thermal vents on the dorsal side of the Titan, causing the Titan to expose its thermal core, which enables damage to the Titan itself.

        <h3>Krait Mk.II</h3>
        <p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> – this build is recommended only as an entry-level stepping stone towards more effective builds.</p>
        <p><strong>PREREQUISITES</strong> – Access to Felicity Farseer is required, and will enable you to engineer your Power Plant, Thrusters, Frame shift Drive, and Sensors. You will need to donate 1x meta alloy, a commodity which can be purchased from Fleet Carriers, for access to Felicity Farseer's engineering workshop. Once access is acquired, you will need to obtain the following engineering materials:</p>
        <pre>7x Iron
3x Hybrid Capacitors
2x Heat Vanes
3x Specialized Legacy Firmware
1x Mechanical Equipment
3x Vanadium
5x Grid Resistors
1x Chromium
1x Mechanical Components</pre>
        <p>If you wish to engineer your sensors for long range you will also need these further materials:</p>
        <pre>3x Iron
2x Hybrid capacitors
1x Unexpected Emission Data</pre>
        <p><strong>USING THIS BUILD</strong> – You will need to run cold to avoid detection by turning off the Frame Shift Drive, Repair Limpet Controller, Auto Field Maintenance Unit, one Heatsink Launcher, and the Cargo Hatch when not in use. Retreat to the asteroid belt near the Titan where enemy ships will not follow, before turning any of these back on for repairs. You will also need to synthesize heatsinks to stay in titan space for any length of time, so it would be prudent to stock up on a large quantity of the following:</p>

# Scout Builds

Hunting scouts is an efficient method to increase combat rank. This is because all scouts are considered dangerous or deadly targets and will give a lot of experience per kill. Scout killers also hold a valuable role in Anti-Xeno Conflict Zones.
Due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Due to the unpredictable flight nature of scouts, we strongly recommend the use of **Large Enhanced Anti-Xeno Multi-Cannons**, either Gimballed or Turreted, as the most effective weapon for hunting scouts.

These are best suited as they are not affected by the 77% resistance, can actively stay on target with scouts and are very ammo-efficient. While vessels used to be limited to four AX Weapons, Azimuth's stabilizers now allow ships to mount up to six, allowing for truly devasating scout killers.

## Extra Modules Suggested

- **Decontamination Limpet Controller (and Cargo Rack)** - For when hit by caustic missiles.
- **Enhanced Xeno Scanner** - Lets you see scout health and type, as well as allowing you to scan Interceptors for heart targeting.
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Thargoids attacks phase through shields, meaning you need strong shields and hull to withstand their attacks.

Ultimately, due to the simple nature of scout hunting, almost any ship can be retrofitted for the task quite easily. A simple rule of thumb is….

- Decent Hull
- Decent Shields
- As many AX Multi-Cannons as you can fit
- Decontamination Limpets

And you’re good to go!

# Spire Builds

Thargoid Spire sites are low-threat conflict zones where Orthrus-type interceptors come and go regularly. Combat in Spire sites assists with the recapturing of systems from Titans. When engaged, Orthrus will summon packs of Scouts, and occasionally a Cyclops, to defend them. Combat bonds for Orthrus kills are especially high at 15 million credits.

As with all Thargoid ships, due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Orthrus have a particularly strong shield, and will fire both a shutdown field, and an anti-Guardian field, when engaged. The shutdown field can be countered with a Shutdown Field Neutraliser. The anti-Guardian field immediately starts eroding the guardian modules and weapons of its target, and cannot be countered. This means when weapons are subjected to the anti-Guardian field, the CMDR is in a race against time to destroy the Orthrus before their weapons completely fail.

## Extra Modules Suggested

- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Thargoids emit caustic clouds when they die, and taking caustic damage is inevitable.
- **Shutdown Field Neutraliser** - For countering the shutdown field emitted by Orthrus and Cyclops on engagement.
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Thargoids attacks phase through shields, meaning you need a strong hull to withstand their attacks.

The general premise of Spire site builds is to create a ship which can survive in the caustic environment without resupplying. this means:

- Decent Hull
- Strong damage to all Thargoid ship types
- Ability to remove caustic damage
- Self-repair functionality

      <h3>Krait Mk.II</h3>
      <p>
        The Krait can fit 3x Large and 2x Medium Enchanced AX Multi-Cannons (for Scouts) or Missile Racks (for Orthrus). It can also be useful to swap 1x class 2 hardpoint for a Thermal Vent Beam Laser, for tagging Orthrus targets at range. The Krait has high mobility to keep targets in range or disengage. Overall, this build has strong all-round performance with great endurance, power and speed, and reasonable damage output. The Missile variant is also particularly useful for clearing the Banshee skimmer-type missile launchers from Spire sites.

      <h3>Krait Mk.II</h3>
      <p>
        This build is very similar to the entry-level Missiles/Multi-cannons build but with enhanced engineering on the power plant to drive powerful Guardian weapons. Modified Guardian plasma chargers and shard cannons are highly effective against Orthrus shields, albeit vulnerable to Anti-Guardian Fields. Auto-Field Maintenance Units are therefore mandatory for these build types.

      <p>
        Recommendation: Agile, packs a punch, and strong enough to fight Cyclops.

      <h3>Anaconda</h3>
      <p>
        CMDR Mechan’s famous “CytoPlasmaConda” build is designed to very effectively strip Orthrus shields. Building this ship equires access to the Cytoscrambler lasers, a PowerPlay module from Archon Delaine. slow but extremely powerful, it is also vulnerable to Anti-Guardian Fields so again, Auto-Field Maintenance Units are mandatory.

      <p>
        Recommendation: Not very agile but huge damage output; requires finesse, especially for escaping interdictions.
